// Graph Algorithm JS Example

// The Data
const airports = 'PHX BKK OKC JFK LAX MEX EZE HEL LOS LAP LIM'.split(' ');
// The split() method of String values takes a pattern and divides this string into an ordered list of substrings by searching for the pattern, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.

const routes = [
  ['PHX', 'LAX'],
  ['PHX', 'JFK'],
  ['JFK', 'OKC'],
  ['JFK', 'HEL'],
  ['JFK', 'LOS'],
  ['MEX', 'LAX'],
  ['MEX', 'BKK'],
  ['MEX', 'LIM'],
  ['MEX', 'EZE'],
  ['LIM', 'BKK'],
];

// The Graph

/* The adjanceny list is more benefical than looping through the array because the array contains many zero's - The matrix would be very spare, hence it would be very inefficient overwise. */

let adjacencyList = new Map(); // Acts like a dictionary or hashmap

// The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

// Add node
function addNode(airport) {
  
  adjacencyList.set(airport, []); // Represents a node on the graph
  // The set syntax binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property.

}

// Add edge, undirected
function addEdge(origin, destination) {
  
  adjacencyList.get(origin).push(destination);

  adjacencyList.get(destination).push(origin); // Inverse

  // The get syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up. 

}

// Create the Graph

airports.forEach(addNode); // Add a node to the graph
//  The forEach() method of Array instances executes a provided function once for each array element.

routes.forEach(route => addEdge(...route)) // Add an edge for each in the array
// The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript.
/* The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created. Spread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax.

The difference?

while the spread operator expands elements of an iterable, the rest operator compresses them. It collects several elements. In functions when we require to pass arguments but were not sure how many we have to pass, the rest parameter makes it easier. Note: There must be only one rest operator in javascript functions.
