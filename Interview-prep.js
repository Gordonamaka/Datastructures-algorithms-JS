// Rules for Interviewing - REACTO

// 0) They Care more about your thinking process more than perfect code!

// 1) Repeat the Question - Understand it

// 2) Write out examples - Given these parameters, what output do you expect?

// 3) Describe your approaches - Talk about your approaches: Would it be an iterative solution? A recursive solution? A heuristic solution? Etc etc

// 4) Write your code - Break down your approach into smaller steps - Breadth first coding - Leave yourself room for edits, star things you're not sure about - They want to see you break down the problem.

// 5) Test - Take examples you wrote down earlier and mark your variables as you're going down the process, where it changes, etc. Understand each part of the process

// 6) -- IMPORTANT -- Optimization & Run-time - How will it perform with larger data sets, etc if I put this code in production, what will happen, what effect will it have?
